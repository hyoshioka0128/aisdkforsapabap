 |Lowering the temperature means that the model will produce more repetitive and deterministic responses. | &&
 |Increasing the temperature will result in more unexpected or creative responses. | &&

 gv_topp_info = |Similar to temperature, this controls randomness but uses a different method. | &&
 |Lowering Top P will narrow the modelâ€™s token selection to likelier tokens. | &&
 |Increasing Top P will let the model choose from tokens with both high and low likelihood.| &&

 gv_freq_info = |Reduce the chance of repeating a token proportionally based on how often it has appeared in the text so far.| &&
 |This decreases the likelihood of repeating the exact same text in a response.|.
